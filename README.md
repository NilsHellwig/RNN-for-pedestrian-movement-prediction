# Pedestrian-RNN
Position prediction using a Recurrent Neural Network.

## About
Predicting the walking paths of pedestrians is an important part of realizing autonomous driving. In this research work, 12 future positions of pedestrians should be predicted based on 8 positions. The data was measured with a laser scanner. The pedestrians were moving at a street intersection. To solve this regression problem, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was implemented with a many-to-one architecture. Tensorflow/Keras was used to implement the architecture.
